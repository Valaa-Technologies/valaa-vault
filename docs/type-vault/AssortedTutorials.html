    <h2>How to create RevDoc</h2>
This is a step-by-step guide on how to create RevDoc using cli.
    <ol>
      <li>Ensure you have python installed.</li>
      <li>Navigate to the folder you want your revdoc.js to reside and run the following command: <blockquote class="vdoc type-revdoc-example">
    <code>
  <div class="vdoc type-vdoc-node">$ <code><span class="vdoc type-vdoc-node"><strong><em class="vdoc type-revdoc-command"><span class="vdoc type-vdoc-node">vlm</span>
</em></strong> write-revdoc YOUR_DOCUMENT_NAME_WITHOUT_FILE_EXTENSION</span>
</code>
  </div>
</code>
  </blockquote> Note: If you create your RevDoc under the revdocs/ folder, your HTML and VDocLD files will be generated to the project root</li>
      <li>You will now be asked the following information: 
    <ul>
      <li>Title of the document: This is human-readable title of the document.</li>
      <li>ReSpec short name</li>
      <li>Document editors: Comma-separated value of the editors of your document.</li>
      <li>Document authors: Comma-separated value of the authors of your document.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
      <li>Next navigate to the root of your project and run the following command <blockquote class="vdoc type-revdoc-example">
    <code>
  <div class="vdoc type-vdoc-node">$ <code><span class="vdoc type-vdoc-node"><strong><em class="vdoc type-revdoc-command"><span class="vdoc type-vdoc-node">vlm</span>
</em></strong> regenerate-docs</span>
</code>
  </div>
</code>
  </blockquote> This will create HTML and VDocLD files based on your RevDoc</li>
      <li>Now run the following command <blockquote class="vdoc type-revdoc-example">
    <code>
  <div class="vdoc type-vdoc-node">$ <code><span class="vdoc type-vdoc-node"><strong><em class="vdoc type-revdoc-command"><span class="vdoc type-vdoc-node">python</span>
</em></strong> -m SimpleHTTPServer</span>
</code>
  </div>
</code>
  </blockquote></li>
      <li>Open browser and navigate to the localhost in the port you just opened. (8000 by default)</li>
      <li>Your HTML and VDocLD files can now be found under docs/ in the same path as where you saved your RevDoc file; for example if you saved your RevDoc under packages/type-vault it can now be found under docs/packages/type-vault.</li>
    </ol>

  <section id="assembling_local_packages" class="vdoc type-vdoc-chapter">
    <h2>How to assemble local packages for local use</h2>
Sometimes you may need to use your own packages with your project. To do this you need to assemble the packages and add them to a local repository from which they can then be used. To assemble your packages and add them to a local repository, run the following command inside your project root:
  <div class="vdoc type-revdoc-command-line-interaction">$ <span class="vdoc type-revdoc-command">vlm assemble-packages --add-unchanged --yalc-push --yalc-add</span>

  </div>
This assembles your packages and adds them to a local Yalc repository. Find out more about Yalc <a href="https://github.com/whitecolor/yalc" class="vdoc type-vdoc-reference">here</a>

  <section id="creating_new_vault" class="vdoc type-vdoc-chapter">
    <h2>Guide on how to create a new vault</h2>
This guide will go through the steps on creating a new vault with valma
    and releasing a prerelease version of it. Setting up credentials
    for npm and setting remote github repository is out of the scope of this guide.
    <ol>
      <li>In case you have not; install valma and valos kernel globally
        through npm by running the following command: 
  <div class="vdoc type-revdoc-command-line-interaction">$ <span class="vdoc type-revdoc-command">sudo npm add -g valma @valos/kernel</span>

  </div>
To ensure that the installation succeeded you can run: 
  <div class="vdoc type-revdoc-command-line-interaction">$ <span class="vdoc type-revdoc-command">vlm</span>

  </div>
</li>
      <li>Create new folder for your vault and navigate there.</li>
      <li>Run the following command: 
  <div class="vdoc type-revdoc-command-line-interaction">$ <span class="vdoc type-revdoc-command">vlm init</span>

  </div>
Following list will go through the steps of the initialization script:
    <ol>
      <li>Select "Initialize" on whether to initialize package.json with 'yarn init'.
            The initialization script will prompt
            multiple questions about the basic information of the package which will be
            written to the root package.json. Answer the questions according
            to the following list: 
    <ul>
      <li>Name should be @valaatech/{YOUR_VAULT_NAME}</li>
      <li>Initial version should be 0.1.0</li>
      <li>Entry point and repository url should be empty</li>
      <li>Author should be "Valaa Technologies Ltd"</li>
      <li>Licenses should be UNLICENSED</li>
      <li>Private should be true as vaults themselves are never
              published</li>
    </ul>
</li>
      <li>Select bypass when asked whether to add more workshops</li>
      <li>Select "Initialize" on whether to initialize repository valos stanza type and domain,
          and then select "vault" from the list of different types.
          Confirm your selection when the scripts asks for it.</li>
      <li>Select "<create new>" when the scripts asks for stanza valos.domain.
          Domain should be @valaatech/{YOUR_VAULT_NAME}.
          Confirm both the domain selection as well as the whole stanza configuration.</li>
      <li>Select "Configure" when asked whether to configure repository
          with "vlm configure".</li>
      <li>For the comma-separated list of package.json .workspaces stanza globs
          the initial "packages/*" will suffice. This list will determine
          the workspaces for the vault. All of the necessary dependencies
          will now be installed.</li>
      <li>Select both "domain" and "docs" when asked to select a toolset
          to be used for the vault. Said toolsets will now be installed.</li>
      <li>Select "Yes" on regeneration of software bill of materials.</li>
      <li>For the public base IRI of the final published vault documents
          put {INSERT_PUBLIC_BASE_IRI_HERE}</li>
      <li>Select "Yes" on regeneration of domain summary revdoc and
          on domain workshop workspace creation.</li>
      <li>Now you need to configure the workspace.
            Following steps will guide you through the configuration.
    <ol>
      <li>Select "Initialize" when asked whether to initialize package.json
              with "yarn init" and "No" when prompted for whether the package
              is public. This will now run the "yarn init" which prompts
              same questions as when initializing vault. Everything
              can be left as default, besides the private which should be false</li>
      <li>Bypass the reconfiguration of valos stanza and choose configure
              when prompted on whether to configure workspace.</li>
    </ol>
Configuration of the workspace is now done</li>
      <li>Select "Export" on whether to export the script skeleton.</li>
      <li>Select "Yes" on git repository initialization</li>
      <li>If you already have set up the remote git repository you can
          now enter the repository url when asked.</li>
      <li>Select "Yes" on whether to set up inital release branch</li>
      <li>Don't select anything when asked for toolsets to use for the vault.</li>
    </ol>
You have now initialized the vault. If everything went accordingly,
        your vault root directory should now contain all basic necessary files.</li>
      <li>Before releasing your vault you need to have commited all changes.
      If there are uncommitted changes that you haven't made, you should amend
      them to the initial commit.</li>
      <li>Releasing your vault is as simple as running the following command:
  <div class="vdoc type-revdoc-command-line-interaction">$ <span class="vdoc type-revdoc-command">vlm release-vault --prerelease</span>

  </div>
This command will run all the set hooks & assemble all the packages
      from your workspaces. If you have configured npm credentials and set up
      remote github repository the script will also publish your packages
      to npm and push the vault to the github repository.</li>
    </ol>
