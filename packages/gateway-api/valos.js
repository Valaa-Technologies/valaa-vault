   * Adds the given spindle to the global valos.spindlePrototypes; this

   * 1. the ValOS application gateway itself, introducing schemas,
   *    schemes, decoders etc.
   * 2. the ValOS fabric, ie. javascript-side code, libraries and
   *    for other spindles by using ValOS require directive (preferred)
   *    or directly through global.valos or window.valos
   * 3. the valospace applications, via its global.valos
   *
   * Spindle loading has three phases.
   * 1. First phase spindles are those that were exported to
   *    valos.spindlePrototypes before gateway initialization. They are
   *    spawn-attached immediately after gateway creation and are
   *    available during the remainder of gateway initialization (this
   *    includes gateway prologue narrations).
   * 2. Second phase spindles are those that are pushed to
   *    valos.spindlePrototypes during gateway initialization. They are
   *    spawn-attached only after init is complete but before views are
   *    created. They are thus not available during revelation prologue
   *    narration, but are available when engine or user interfaces are
   *    deployed.
   * 3. Third phase spindles are those which are pushed to
   *    valos.spindlePrototypes at any later stage. They are
   *    spawn-attached at best-effort basis; they can thus end up being
   *    loaded even before views are attached in some circumstances.
