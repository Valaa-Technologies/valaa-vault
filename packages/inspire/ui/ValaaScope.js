/**
 * ValaaScope performs a semantically rich, context-aware render of its local UI focus according to
 * following rules:
 *
 * 1. If component is disabled (ie. its local UI context is undefined):
 *    value-renders (value-rendering defined in section 9.) props/context "disabledLens".
 *    disabledLens must not make any UI context nor UI focus references.
 *
 * 2. If main UI focus kuery is still pending (ie. UI focus is undefined):
 *    value-renders props/context "pendingLens", "loadingLens" or "disabledLens".
 *    A pending kuery is an asynchronous operation which hasn't returned the initial set of values.
 *    pendingLens can refer to UI context normally, but cannot refer to (still-undefined) UI focus.
 *
 * 3. If props.lens or context.lens is defined:
 *    value-renders props/context "lens".
 *    This allows overriding any further render semantics with a specific, hard-coded UI element
 *    which still knows that the main UI focus kuery has been completed.
 *    lens can refer to UI context and UI focus normally.
 *
 * 4. If UI focus is null:
 *    value-renders props/context "nullLens" or "disabledLens".
 *
 * 5. If UI focus is a string, a number, a React element, a function or a boolean:
 *    value-renders focus.
 *    This is the basic literal value rendering rule.
 *    Any React element or function content can refer to UI context and UI focus normally.
 *
 * 6. If UI focus is a Valaa resource, an appropriate Valaa Lens for it is located and rendered
 *    (with the resource set as its focus) as per rules below.
 *    Valaa Lens is a UI component which always has Valaa Resource as its focus.
 * 6.1. If UI focus is not an Active Valaa resource, ie. if any of its partitions does not have a
 *    fully formed active connection, then:
 * 6.1.1. If UI focus is an Inactive Valaa resource, ie. if some of its partitions are not connected
 *    and no connection attempt is being made:
 *    value-renders props/context "inactiveLens" or "disabledLens".
 * 6.1.2. If UI focus is an Activating Valaa resource, ie. if all of its partitions are either
 *    connected or a connection attempt is being made:
 *    value-renders props/context "activatingLens", "loadingLens" or "disabledLens".
 * 6.1.3. If UI focus is an Unavailable Valaa resource, ie. if some of its partitions connections
 *    have failed (due to networks issues, permission issues etc.):
 *    value-renders props/context "unavailableLens" or "disabledLens".
 * 6.1.4. If UI focus is a Destroyed Valaa resource:
 *    value-renders props/context "destroyedLens" or "disabledLens".
 * 6.2. If props.activeLens or context.activeLens is defined:
 *    value-renders props/context "activeLens".
 *    Like lens this overrides all further render semantics, but unlike lens
 *    the activeLens content can assume that UI focus is always a valid Valaa Resource.
 * 6.3. if either props.lensProperty or context.lensProperty is defined (lensProperty from hereon)
 *    and getFocus().propertyValue(lensProperty) is defined:
 *    value-renders getFocus().propertyValue(lensProperty).
 * 6.4. otherwise:
 *    value-renders props/context "lensPropertyNotFoundLens" or "disabledLens".
 *
 * 7. If UI focus is an array or a plain object, ValaaScope behaves as if it was a ForEach component
 *    and renders the focus as a sequence, with following rules:
 * 7.1. all ValaaScope props which ForEach uses are forwarded to ForEach as-is,
 * 7.2. props.EntryUIComponent default value is ValaaScope instead of UIComponent,
 * 7.3. if UI focus is a plain object it is converted into an array using following rules:
 * 7.3.1. array entries are the UI focus object values, ordered lexicographically by their keys,
 * 7.3.2. the ForEach entry props (and thus the React key) for each entry element is created using
 *    childProps(key, { ... }) instead of uiComponentProps({ ... }).
 *
 * 8. Otherwise:
 *    throws a failure for unrecognized UI focus (ie. a complex non-recognized object)
 *
 * 9. value-render process renders a given value(s) directly ie. without further valaa or react
 *    operations), as follows:
 * 9.1. if value-render is given multiple values, the first one which is defined is used as value,
 * 9.2. if value === false, if value === null or if it is not defined:
 *    renders null.
 * 9.3. if value is a function:
 *    value-renders value(getUIContext()).
 *    The current UI focus can be found in getUIContext().focus.
 * 9.4. if value === true:
 *    renders props.children.
 * 9.5. if value is a string, number, or a React element:
 *    renders value.
 * 9.6. if value is a valaa Resource:
 *    renders <ValaaScope focus={value} />.
 * 9.7. otherwise:
 *    throws an exception for unrecognized value
 *
