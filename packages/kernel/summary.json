A tool is similar to\na toolset in that it can have its own workspace specific\nconfigurations. A tool differs from a toolset in that it cannot be\nstandalone; it doesn't appear in listings, its always part of one or\nmore toolsets and its toolsets.json config stanzas are placed under\nits parent toolset stanzas.\n\nThe main case for tools and toolsets separation came from the release\ndeployment system of opspaces, where the modularity and granular\nsemantic versioning of tool packages allows for more efficient and\nrobust deployments.\n\nTool workspaces allows splitting complex toolsets into separate\ntools with different deployment logic. Infrastructure code which\nchanges rarily can be placed under tool packages with naive\ndeployment logic which relies on the tool package version number only.\nFrequently changing configs can be managed by the toolset workspace\nitself but even it can then use tool workspaces to source in\ncommands and other resources to help with the deployment management.\n\nAdditionally because the tool configuration is always inside its\nparent toolset config this allows the same tool be used by several\ndifferent toolsets in a single workspace. Because of this all tool\ncommands must have an option for '--toolset=<@scope/toolsetname>' which\nuses yargs.vlm.toolset as its default value.\n"

In this case a pre-publish phase is done which\nprepares the manual publish command instructions in the results output.\n\nWill invoke valma command hooks between stages as per:\n1.
