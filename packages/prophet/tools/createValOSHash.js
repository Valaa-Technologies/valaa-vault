/**
 * Returns a 240-bit SHAKE256 hash of the given utf-8 text string
 * utf8Text as as a base64-url encoded string (ie. [A-Za-z0-9\-_]{40}).
 *
 * Bit-count choice rationale:
 * 1. practicality: divisible by 6 and 8 for exact representation both
 *    in base64-url and octets formats
 * 2. security: preimage attack strength 240 is close enough to the max ~256 of SHAKE256
 *    (see https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.202.pdf , A.1 Summary)
 * 3. security: collision attack strength 120 is still better than SHA3-224
 * 4. aesthetics: base64-url length at 40 is only 4 chars longer than uuidv4: tolerable.
 * 5. aesthetics: octet length at 30 fits snugly in 32 bytes, for whatever that's worth.
 * 6. debugging: as 40 char base64-url string a ValOS hash should in
 *    practice be recognizable and differentiable from other similar
 *    identifiers in various listings.
