# @valos/raem provides Valaa Resources And Events Model `ValaaRAEM` (/vælɑːɹɛem/)

Provides the central Valaa technologies: the Valaa Resource Model and
the Valaa Event Model. Provides the connection between these in the
form of `reducers` which convert event streams into in-memory Valaa
resources and their updates. Provides schema definitions for `Resource`
and other essential Valaa resource model interfaces. Provides a kuery
language `VALK` for accessing and making limited manipulations to the
resources. Provides the low level APIs for manipulating partitions.
Implements `ghost instancing` for the Valaa resource model;
a generalization extension of the traditional prototypical inheritance
which recursively inherits the sub-components of the prototype as
transparent but selectively modifiable `ghosts`. Provides referential
integrity to the resource model via `couplings`.

## 1. Valaa URIS, references and raw id's

Valaa URI (is a URI used to specify a reference to a Valaa Resource.
It has two major parts separated by the URI fragment separator `#`:
*partition URI* part and a *local reference* part.

*Partition URI* identifies the target authority and partition of
the reference. It corresponds to scheme, hierarchical and query parts
of an URI; everything but the fragment. Its precise structure and
interpretation is specified by the scheme but typically the scheme and
hierarchical part identify an authority and query part identifies
a partition.

*Local reference* identifies a particular resource inside a partition
but also contains optional *coupling*, *ghost path*, *lens* (and other)
parts which further parameterize the reference itself. It corresponds
to the URI fragment part but has sub-structure which is specified in
this document.

#### 1.1. Curious pluralistic dualisms of *partition URI* and *local reference*

The division between partition URI and local reference has many curious
dualistic qualities: backend vs. frontend, hierarchical vs. flat,
routing vs. computation, extensible vs. fixed, absolute vs. contextual,
coarse vs. granular, self-contained vs. part-of-a-whole.

##### 1.1.1. Partition URI domain is backend, local reference domain is front-end

Valaa backends deal with the indivisible partitions and thus don't care
about the particularities of local references to individual resources.
This corresponds to how in web architecture URI fragments are not sent
to backend with resource requests. Conversely, Valaa frontends don't
care where a resource comes from once it has been loaded, but about its
identity, relationships and the parameters of those relationships. This
is reflected in how frontend code regularily drops the partition URI.

##### 1.1.2. Partition URI structure is specified by the scheme, local reference structure is specified by Valaa

By the nature of its distributed event sourcing architecture Valaa
focuses heavily on the frontend. The cross-compatibility between
components is driven by how new backends can integrate and talk with
existing front-end clients. This is facilitated by front-end plugin
systems which enables new valaa URI schemes to specify new routing
solutions and fundamentally new backend infrastructures, as long as
said infrastructures can route valaa event streams to clients. This
corresponds to how Valaa doesn't specify how a *partition URI*
identifies and locates partitions and authorities but leaves it to
the scheme specifications and their reference implementations of
frontend plugins.

##### 1.1.3. Partitions URI's identify self-contained wholes, resource references need their context

Web architecture specifies that all or none of the document is
retrieved. This corresponds to the behaviour of Valaa partitions which
are always retrieved as a whole. Partition URI's contain all and
nothing but the components which identify web resources, that is
everything but the fragment.

##### 1.1.4. Etc.

### 1.2. Resource id

Resources have id's, which are strings with one or more parts separated
by `:`. The first, non-optional *primary* part globally uniquely
identifies a freely movable resource. The secondary parts identify
sub-resources which are tightly bound to the primary resource.

Two resource ids refer to the same resource if and only if their string
representations are equivalent. Notably:
1. all parts are case sensitive. If a part specification refers to a
   case insensitive system it must specify a canonical representation,
   with the recommended representation being all-lowercase.
2. no redundant encoding. If a part contains encoding schemes then any
   characters or tokens which can expressed without encoding must not
   be encoded.

#### 1.2.1 Primary id part - restricted naming, free ownership

The primary id part has a restricted character set of `unreserved`
as specified in the [URI specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986).

The *primary* part must be globally unique.
Note: uuid v4 is recommended for now, but eventually primary id
generation should tied to the deterministic event id chain. This in
turn should be seeded by some ValOS authority.

Note: when using base64 encoded values as primary id, use
[ie. url-and-filename-ready base64url characters](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648#section-5).

Note: derivedId currently used by the codebase uses only the primary id
but breaks the above character set requirement, as it uses base64
encoding with `+` and `/` . For backwards compatibility they are
permitted, but [considered equal to the base64url](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515#appendix-C)
using `+` <-> `-`, `/` <-> `_` character mappings.

### 1.2.1 Secondary - lenient naming, restricted ownership

The *secondary* id parts has a character set restricted to `reg-name`.
Character set is treated case senstively. Any characters in the set
which can be expressed without percent encoding must not be percent
encoded.

They are used for various types of deterministic resources with some
restricted behaviour:

TODO(iridian): Elaborate these.

1. instance-ghost ids
  `f00:>ba54:>b7e4` - where `b7e4` is a traditional resource, `ba54:>b7e4`
  reads as "a ghost in instance `ba54` with ghost prototype `b7e4`" and
  `f00:>ba54:>b7e4` reads as "instance `f00` ownling ghost of `ba54:>b7e4`".
  Etc.
2. property ids
  `f00:.propName` - a directly owned Property with fixed name `propName`
  and prototype implicitly locked to `f00-prototype:.propName`.
3. virtual resource ids
  permanently immaterial ghosts with nevertheless separate identities.
  When used as prototype with instance-ghosts allows salty duplication
  of the same fundamental prototype
  `f00:/1:>b74e`
  `f00:/2:>b74e`
  `f00:/3:>b74e`

Resources identified by these parts are tightly bound to the resource
identified by the primary party (which must exist). They must be always
directly or indirectly owned by the primary resource.

operations.
