      /* TODO(iridian): Implement data reference fields.
        * This way we could have three paired shadowField list couplings:
        * Data.referredDatas <-> Data.referringDatas
        * Data.referredResources <-> Resource.referringDatas
        * Resource.referredDatas <-> Data.referringResources
        * shadowField couplings are
        * 1. derivative: not considered part of the Data identity proper and not factored in in the
        *                Data id generation. This allows them to change.
        * 2. contextual: not globally comprehensive in time or space. They are not guaranteed to
        *                list absolutely every possible coupling, only those which are known in
        *                context. This context is defined by interactions with the local front-end
        *                Prophet.
        * This allows shadow-lists to change locally in given Prophet when references known to that
        * Prophet are being created and destroyed.
        * The referredResources is transitive by referredDatas: if Data A has a referred Data B, and
        * B has a referred Resource R, then A also will have referred Resource R. This allows the
        * full Data graph be mapped out with a single kuery without recursion.
        * For example, take the following FIELDS_SET:
        * fieldsSet({ id, typeName: "MyResource", sets: {
        *   myResourceData: { myDataSubData: { subDataTargetResource: myResourceId } },
        * } });
        * Two Data are specified as expanded objects, inner one containing subDataTargetResource and
        * outer one containing myDataSubData. But because recursively both contain a Resource
        * reference in myResourceId, both of these would be consolidated and given an id.
        * Also, _both_ consolidated Data objects would contain myResourceId in their
        * Data.referredResources and thus conversely myResourceId:Resource.referringDatas will
        * contain both Data id's. Thus a simple kuery:
        * vMyResource.get(
        *   VALK.to("referringDatas")
        *   .select({ "id": "id", "referringResources": "referringResources",
        *       referringDatas": ["referringDatas", "id"] })
        * );
        * Will nicely return all referring Data objects and their local structure as O(n*d) op.
        * n is the number of incoming references and d the average (over n) depth of nested Data's.
        * For most practical purposes this is O(n) (O(nlogn) if d ~ O(logn)).
