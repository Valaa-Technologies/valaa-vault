 *
 * This principle is there to ensure the lookup state is always
 * consistent or blocked. Eventually a reducer will fail in production.
 * This is treated as an internal error, it shall halt the event
 * sourcing so that queries will still work, escalate the issue and
 * initiate recovery mechanisms. Servers should in principle hold
 * minimalistic state to localize the consequences of a corrupted
 * action.
 *
 * The guidelines to help with this rule:
 * 1. Reducers never wait on external resources. External resources can
 *    fail.
 * 2. Reducers are never async. Event time is linear so there's no
 *    benefit, but risks.
 * 3. Only exceptions allowed are internal errors which will be
 *    escalated.
