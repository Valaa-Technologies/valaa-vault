/**
 * Creates the root server reducer.

 * Golden rules of reduction: Reducers always succeed.
 *
 * This principle is there to ensure the lookup state is always consistent or blocked.
 * Eventually a reducer will fail in production. This is treated as an internal error, it shall halt
 * the event sourcing so that queries will still work, escalate the issue and initiate recovery
 * mechanisms. Servers should in principle hold minimalistic state to localize the consequences of
 * a corrupted action.
 *
 * The guidelines to help with this rule:
 * 1. Reducers never wait on external resources. External resources can fail.
 * 2. Similarily reducers are never async. Event time is linear so there's no benefit, but risks.
 * 3. Only exceptions allowed are internal errors which will be escalated.
 * 4. Hook function calls must always be done by delayCall(() => doHookCallbackstuff) which will
 *    perform the callback once the reducer has finished executing.
 *
 * To facilitate middleware which does preliminary reduction based validation of actions:
 * 5. All side-effects must be wrapped inside delayCall, so that if a reduction of a new action
 *    fails the delayed calls (and the candidate reduction state head) can be safely discarded.
